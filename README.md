# Learning The Rust Programming Language

## What it is
A study repo for learning the Rust programming language.
 
## How it does
- Follows [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ "doc.rust-lang.org") book content.
- Uses a Github's [automated kanban project](https://github.com/bandrefilipe/learn-rust/projects/1 "github.com") to keep track of progression.
- [Issues](https://github.com/bandrefilipe/learn-rust/issues "github.com") are used, each encapsulating a whole book chapter, with tasks for each chapter's topic.
- [Pull requests](https://github.com/bandrefilipe/learn-rust/pulls "github.com") are used to merge new code into `main` branch, each linked to (and resolving) an issue.
